TBD
-- implement the interface with the memory, memory.cc | basically done, still loadRWMem
-- initialise the cache in loader.cpp | skipped 

NEED TO CHECK
-- def.h set the coefficients of the cache, especially the cycle

22:16
changed name of class Memory in the simulator into Memory_SIM, to solve the confliction between it and the memory simulator

finished the interface, need to do the test. git commit here
